# Russound RIO Integration - Complete Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the Russound RIO integration for your Unfolded Circle Remote R3.

## Prerequisites

- Unfolded Circle Remote R3 (firmware 2.0.0 or higher)
- Russound MCA-88 or compatible device with RIO protocol support
- Both devices connected to the same network
- IP address of your Russound controller

## Step 1: Find Your Russound Controller's IP Address

### Option A: Using Your Router
1. Log into your router's admin interface
2. Look for "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Client List"
3. Find your Russound device (often listed as "MCA-88" or similar)
4. Note the IP address

### Option B: Using the Russound App
1. Open the Russound app on your phone/tablet
2. Go to Settings â†’ System Information
3. The IP address should be displayed

### Option C: Set a Static IP (Recommended)
1. Access your Russound controller's web interface
2. Configure a static IP address to prevent it from changing
3. This ensures the integration remains connected

## Step 2: Download the Integration

### From GitHub Releases (Recommended)
1. Visit: https://github.com/ferdaze/uc-intg-russound/releases
2. Download the latest `uc-intg-russound-aarch64.tar.gz` file
3. Save it to your computer
